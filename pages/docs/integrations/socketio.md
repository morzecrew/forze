summary: Expose operations as real-time Socket.IO commands
---

`forze[socketio]` is an inbound transport — like [FastAPI](fastapi.md), but for
real-time events. It routes Socket.IO commands to Forze operations, validates
payloads, and resolves the execution context per connection.

## Install

```bash
uv add 'forze[socketio]'
```

No service for a single worker; an optional **Redis** backplane enables delivery
across multiple processes.

## Build the server

```python
from forze_socketio import build_socketio_server, build_socketio_asgi_app

sio = build_socketio_server()            # pass redis_url=... for multi-process
asgi = build_socketio_asgi_app(sio)      # or mount alongside a FastAPI app
```

## Route commands to operations

Declare commands on a namespace router — each maps an event to an operation, with
typed payload and optional ack — then bind them through the adapter:

```python
from forze_socketio import ForzeSocketIOAdapter, SocketIONamespaceRouter

chat = SocketIONamespaceRouter(namespace="/chat")
chat.command(event="message.send", operation="messages.create", payload_type=SendMessage, ack_type=ReadMessage)

adapter = ForzeSocketIOAdapter(
    sio=sio,
    context_factory=lambda request: runtime.get_context(),  # tenant/deps wiring here
    operation_resolver=registry.resolve,                     # the frozen registry
)
adapter.include_router(chat)
```

On each event the adapter builds the context, validates the payload, runs the
operation, and returns the (validated) result as the Socket.IO ack.

## Errors and identity

Every handler runs inside an error boundary: a `CoreException` is acked as
`{"error": {"detail", "code", "kind", ...}}` honoring the same egress policy as
the HTTP boundary — server-side kinds (internal, infrastructure, configuration,
concurrency) and unexpected exceptions are logged and acked with a generic
detail, so internals never leak to clients. An optional `identity_resolver`
on the adapter authenticates connections at connect time (refusing them via
`ConnectionRefusedError` when it raises, e.g. `exc.authentication`) and binds
the resolved `AuthnIdentity` onto the invocation context around each event;
without one, handlers run unauthenticated and governance hooks that require
identity will deny. Tenant resolution stays in the `context_factory`.

## What it provides

| Surface | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `SocketIONamespaceRouter.command(...)` | inbound: event → operation, with typed payload/ack |
| `SocketIOEventEmitter` | outbound: typed, validated server-to-client emits |

## Notes

- The registry must be **frozen** (`OperationRegistry(...).freeze()`), same as
  any transport.
- `operation_resolver` is the registry's own `resolve` — its signature is
  `(operation_key, context)`.
- Payloads validate through a per-route Pydantic `TypeAdapter`; authenticate
  connections with `identity_resolver`, bind tenant in the `context_factory`.
- Multi-process delivery needs the Redis backplane (`redis_url=`); without it the
  server is single-worker.
