"""Key directory — resolves a tenant to its key-encryption-key reference.

This is the encryption analog of tenant routing: it maps a tenant to the
:class:`KeyRef` whose key wraps that tenant's data keys. A single-key deployment
returns the same reference for everyone (:class:`StaticKeyDirectory`); a
per-tenant deployment derives a distinct reference per tenant
(:class:`TenantTemplateKeyDirectory`), which is the BYOK shape — each tenant's
data is wrapped under that tenant's own customer-managed key.

The port is async so a directory can fetch a customer-registered key reference
from a store; the shipped implementations resolve synchronously.
