"""Generated FastAPI routes for authn flows.

Projects the authn operations of a frozen registry (built with
:func:`forze_kits.aggregates.authn.build_authn_registry`) onto a user-owned
:class:`fastapi.APIRouter`. Authn flows are RPC-shaped commands with exactly one
natural HTTP surface each — there is no resource to address, so there is no
style choice: every operation is a ``POST`` on a fixed action path (``/login``,
``/refresh``, ``/logout``, ``/change-password``, ``/password-reset/request``,
``/password-reset/confirm``, ``/deactivate``). Schemas come from the operation
descriptors and each route's ``operation_id`` is the registry operation key
verbatim.

Authentication posture (read this before exposing the router):

- ``/login``, ``/refresh``, ``/password-reset/request``, and
  ``/password-reset/confirm`` are *meant* to be reachable without a bearer
  token — the operations themselves authenticate (password / refresh-token /
  reset-token credentials in the body, or none at all for the reset request).
  :class:`SecurityContextMiddleware` with non-required ingress simply binds no
  identity and lets the request through; nothing in the generated routes
  demands one.
- ``/password-reset/request`` answers a **uniform 202 acknowledgment** for
  known and unknown logins alike (no account enumeration) and never carries the
  reset token in its response — delivery happens out of band via the
  ``reset_events`` outbox seam of ``build_authn_registry`` (or a custom
  handler). Rate-limit this route at the edge; it is an unauthenticated write.
  ``/password-reset/confirm`` answers a uniform 401 for every bad-token flavor.
- ``/logout`` and ``/change-password`` are self-guarding at the *handler* level:
  ``build_authn_registry`` binds no before-hooks, but both handlers resolve the
  bound :class:`~forze.application.contracts.authn.AuthnIdentity` and raise a
  401 (``auth_required``) when none is present. The identity comes from the
  boundary middleware verifying the caller's access token.
- ``/deactivate`` (``deactivate_principal``) has **no built-in guard at all** —
  the handler calls the deactivation port directly. It is an admin-grade
  operation: bind :class:`~forze.application.hooks.authn.AuthnRequired` and an
  authz before-hook (e.g.
  :class:`~forze.application.hooks.authz.AuthzBeforeAuthorize`) on its operation
  before exposing it, or keep it off the router via ``include=``.

Responses of ``/login`` and ``/refresh`` carry token material in the body by
design (the OAuth2-shaped :class:`~forze_kits.aggregates.authn.AuthnTokenResponseDTO`);
the stock :class:`~forze_fastapi.middlewares.LoggingMiddleware` logs only
method/path/status/duration, never bodies — keep any custom access logging
equally body-blind.

    """Attach the registered authn operations under *ns* to *router*.

    One ``POST`` route per registered :class:`AuthnKernelOp`, on a fixed action
    path — authn flows are RPC-shaped with one natural surface each, so there is
    no ``style`` argument:

    - ``POST /login`` → ``password_login`` (200, token response DTO)
    - ``POST /refresh`` → ``refresh_tokens`` (200, token response DTO)
    - ``POST /logout`` → ``logout`` (204, no request body)
    - ``POST /change-password`` → ``change_password`` (204)
    - ``POST /password-reset/request`` → ``request_password_reset`` (202, uniform ack DTO)
    - ``POST /password-reset/confirm`` → ``reset_password`` (204)
    - ``POST /deactivate`` → ``deactivate_principal`` (204)
    - ``POST /api-keys`` → ``issue_api_key`` (201, the secret returned once)
    - ``GET /api-keys`` → ``list_api_keys`` (non-secret descriptors)
    - ``DELETE /api-keys/{id}`` → ``revoke_api_key`` (204)

    Self-service API-key management is a real resource collection, so it uses
    resource-style verbs (the auth-flow actions stay ``POST``). All three require a
    bound identity (``AuthnRequired`` — a 401 without one).

    Each route's ``operation_id`` is the operation key verbatim (e.g.
    ``main.password_login``); request/response schemas come from the operation
    descriptors, and every call dispatches through ``run_operation`` — plans and
    hooks apply, no bypass.

    The router is expected to be reachable **without** a bearer token: login,
    refresh, and both password-reset flows authenticate via their request
    bodies (or, for the reset request, not at all — it answers a uniform 202
    for known and unknown logins, see the module docstring), not the security
    context. Guarding the other flows is the operation plan's (or handler's)
    job, not the route's — ``logout`` and ``change_password`` already raise a
    401 from their handlers when no identity is bound, while
    ``deactivate_principal`` ships unguarded: bind
    :class:`~forze.application.hooks.authn.AuthnRequired` plus an authz
    before-hook on it (see the module docstring), or exclude it via
    ``include=``.

    :param router: A plain FastAPI router the caller owns.
    :param registry: Frozen registry holding the authn operations.
    :param ns: Namespace the operations were registered under
        (e.g. ``spec.default_namespace``). Mutually exclusive with *resource*;

    :param include: Optional narrowing to a subset of kernel operations; including
        an operation the registry lacks is a configuration error.

        namespace is built from; must equal the prefix the operations were
        registered under. Mutually exclusive with *ns*; provide exactly one.
    :param path_overrides: Optional per-operation route-path replacements (keyed
        like *include*); only the path changes, the ``operation_id`` stays
        verbatim. An override must keep any ``{id}`` placeholder the default path
        binds.
    :returns: *router*, for chaining.
