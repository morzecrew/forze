    Opens a transaction on *tx_route*, marks the message processed via the inbox,
    and runs *handler* in the **same transaction** — so the dedup mark and the
    handler's writes commit atomically. A redelivered message (already marked in a
    prior committed transaction) is skipped.

    **Dedup id priority**: an explicit *message_id* extractor wins; otherwise
    the ``forze_event_id`` header (written by the outbox relay), then
    ``message.id``. ``message.key`` is never used: the relay publishes ``key``
    as the staged *ordering key* when one is set — a **grouping** key that
    two **different** events of the same aggregate share, so deduping on it
    would silently drop the second event. The broker message id is the
    delivery identity (stable across redeliveries), so a redelivery of the
    **same** message is skipped even without the header.

    **Envelope rebinding** — when the message carries the well-known envelope
    headers (see :mod:`forze.application.contracts.envelope`, written by the
    outbox relay), invocation metadata is bound around the dedup mark and the
    handler so tracing survives the broker hop:

    - ``correlation_id`` — the ``forze_correlation_id`` header value: the
      handler runs under the *originating* correlation id.
    - ``causation_id`` — the consumed event's id (the ``forze_event_id``
      header): the consumed event *causes* the handler's effects, extending
      the standard causation chain. ``message.key`` is never used — it is the
      ordering key, not an event identity.
    - ``execution_id`` — kept from the already-bound consumer metadata when
      present (processing a message is its own execution), otherwise a fresh
      id.

    Without a parseable correlation header the binding is skipped entirely
    (current behavior). Malformed UUID header values are ignored.

    :param bind_tenant_from_headers: **Opt-in** (default ``False``): when
        ``True`` and the ``forze_tenant_id`` header carries a valid UUID, the
        tenant identity is bound for the handler scope. Opt-in because headers
        are untrusted input — within a deployment they are written by the
        application's own relay, but any producer with broker access could
        forge them; only enable this for brokers where every producer is
        trusted to assert tenancy.
    :returns: ``True`` if the message was processed, ``False`` if skipped as a duplicate.
