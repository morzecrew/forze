"""`find_vertices_stream` / `find_edges_stream` — the keyset walk and the three refusals.

Streaming exists because the offset-paged `find_*` cannot promise *completeness*: `SKIP n`
counts rows from the start of a result set that is being written underneath it, so a vertex
created before the cursor shifts every later row one place along and the next page skips one.
For an export, a skipped page and an empty page produce the same artifact — which is why the
walk seeks by key instead, and why the refusals below fail closed rather than serving a scan
that looks complete and is not.
